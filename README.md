## üåå - About 42

[42 School](https://www.42network.org/) is a global education initiative that offers a unique approach to learning technology. With a focus on practical skills and self-directed learning, 42 School provides an immersive environment where students learn from their peers.

There are no traditional classrooms or teachers at 42 School. Instead, students engage in peer-to-peer learning, collaborating on projects and challenges to develop their skills.

The [42cursus](42cursus), the curriculum at 42 School, covers a wide range of technical topics and fosters the development of critical skills such as problem-solving and teamwork.

## üìñ - Curriculum

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the __Common Core__, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.
