  <p>
    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for 
    distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where 
    hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can 
    easily access. 
    <br>
    For example, by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web 
    pages to clients. 
    <br>
    The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext 
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include 
    images, style sheets, and scripts in addition to the text content.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates 
    communication by requesting a specific resource using HTTP and the server 
    responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to 
    do so.
    <br>
    The resource is typically a real file on the server‚Äôs secondary storage, 
    but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the webserver is 
    implemented.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP 
    also includes ways of receiving content from clients.
    <br>
    This feature is used for submitting web forms, including the uploading of 
    files.
