# MiniRT

<i>
  <p>
    When it comes to rendering 3-dimensional computer-generated images there are 2 possible approaches: “Rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because of its efficiency and “Ray Tracing.”
  </p>
  <p>
	The “Ray Tracing” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon since) is even today more expensive in computation than the “Rasterization” method.
	<br>
	As a result, it is not yet fully adapted to real time use-cases but it produce a much higher degree of visual realism.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before you can even begin to produce such high-quality graphics, you must master the basics: the miniRT is your first ray tracer coded in C, normed and humble but functionnal.
  </p>
  <p>
	The main goal of miniRT is to prove to yourself that you can implement any mathematics or physics formulas without being a mathematician, we will only implement the most basics ray tracing features here so just keep calm, take a deep breath and don’t panic!
	<br>
	After this project you’ll be able to show off nice-looking pictures to justify the number of hours you’re spending at school...
